Hi there! I just started my career as a security researcher and am particularly interested in digital forensics, malware analysis and threat intelligence.

Projects:
- [PcapFS](https://github.com/fkie-cad/pcapFS): PcapFS is a powerful network forensics tool that extracts, decodes and decrypts the payload of captured network traffic and has many convenient features\
    (e.g. reconstruction of SMB shares on the basis of the captured traffic, we also wrote a [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666281724001318) for that) 
- Finding new techniques for proactive C2 server detection through scanning (take a look [here](https://github.com/axmahr/QuasarRAT-Family-Detection))
- Reversing and systematizing C2 protocols
